Bat vs Rat: The Forage Files 🦇🐀

This repository contains our HIT140 – Foundations of Data Science (Assessment 2) project.
The study investigates whether Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) perceive black rats (Rattus rattus) as food competitors or potential predators.

📊 Project Overview

Objective: Investigation A — Analyse bat foraging behaviour in the presence of rats.

Datasets:

dataset1.csv — Records of 907 bat landings (timing, risk, reward, vigilance).

dataset2.csv — Rat arrivals in 30-minute intervals (presence, duration, food availability).

Tools & Libraries: Python (pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats).

🔎 Analysis Workflow

Data Import & Cleaning – Combined datasets, handled missing values, engineered new features such as vigilance proxy and rat presence flag.

Descriptive Analysis – Summarised risk-taking, foraging success, and vigilance behaviour.

Inferential Statistics – Applied Mann–Whitney U test and Chi-square test to explore behavioural patterns.

Visualisations – Boxplots, bar charts, and seasonal comparisons to communicate findings clearly.
